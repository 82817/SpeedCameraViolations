Chicago experiences roughly 3,000 crashes annually between motor vehicles and pedestrians, about 800 of which involve children.

The Children’s Safety Zone Program protects children and other pedestrians by reminding motorists to slow down and obey speed laws – especially in school and park zones. Safety zones are designated as a 1/8th of a mile boundary around any Chicago parks or schools.

The enforcement hours will be limited from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in safety zones around schools on school days (Monday through Friday)
7 a.m. to 4 p.m.: 20 miles per hour (mph) speed limit when children are present; and the posted speed limit when no children are present

7 a.m. to 7 p.m.: The posted speed limit

The enforcement hours around parks will be limited to only those hours parks are open (typically 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., 7 days a week) with a 30 mph speed limit

Only warnings will be issued for the first 30 days after a cameras are newly-established in a safety zone

The first time a vehicle owner is eligible to receive an actual ticket, they will instead receive a warning notice

Fines for violations are $35 for vehicles traveling 6-10 mph over the posted speed limit while in a safety zone, and $100 for vehicles traveling 11 or more mph over the posted speed limit.  

# Finding 1

While number of violations decline over time, number of crashes seem to go up.

This could be the case that people are used to the location of the cameras. Also, the location of the crash might not be close to camera location. Regardless, it is concerning to see number of crashes go up
